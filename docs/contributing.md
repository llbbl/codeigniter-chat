- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üìù `:memo:` when adding or updating documentation
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
  - ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance

- Constants should be UPPERCASE (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`)

### Documentation

- Use PHPDoc comments for classes, methods, and properties
- Include a brief description, parameter types, and return types
- Example:
  ```php
  /**
   * Truncates a string to the specified length
   *
   * @param string $string The string to truncate
   * @param int $length The maximum length of the string
   * @param string $suffix The suffix to add to truncated strings
   * @return string The truncated string
   */
  public function truncate(string $string, int $length, string $suffix = '...'): string
  {
      // Method implementation
  }
  ```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use ES6 features when appropriate
- Document functions with JSDoc comments

### CSS/SASS Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use kebab-case for class names (e.g., `my-class`)
- Group related properties together
- Add comments for complex selectors or rules

## Testing
